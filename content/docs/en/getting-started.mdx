### What's Project Raccoon?  
Project Raccoon is a simple application to create, sign, and manage sell contracts.  
It offers a simple to use interface to create new contracts from templates made by administrators.  

Both the buyer and seller must sign the document for it to be considered legally binding.  

### Profile
