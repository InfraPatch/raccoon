Contracts use field parameters to fill in the required information.

Each contract template should have at least one seller field, and one buyer
field. At the same time they also require: `{signature_date}`,
`{seller_signature}`, and `{buyer_signature}`.

There are two types of fields:

* **Default** (default fields take their default data from user settings)
* **Custom**

Both can be edited while filling out the contract by each party.

### Default fields

| Seller                  | Buyer                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| {seller_name}           | {buyer_name}           |
| {seller_birth_place}    | {buyer_birth_place}    |
| {seller_birth_date}     | {buyer_birth_date}     |
| {seller_mother_name}    | {buyer_mother_name}    |
| {seller_nationality}    | {buyer_nationality}    |
| {seller_id_number_type} | {buyer_id_number_type} |
| {seller_id_number}      | {buyer_id_number}      |
| {seller_phone_number}   | {buyer_phone_number}   |
| {seller_email}          | {buyer_email}          |

`{signature_date}` is a special field which contains the date on which the
contract was signed by both parties.

`{seller_signature}` and `{buyer_signature}` both get replaced by the seller and
buyer names both uppercased.

### Custom fields
Example custom fields: `{item_name}`, `{item_description}`
