## Creating a new Property category

To create a new Property category, you have to give it a name, and a short description.
The slug is automatically filled based on the name of the category, but can be edited.

You can check out all of the previously created categories under **Property categories**.

## Adding new fields to an existing Property category:

Under **Property categories**, choose one category, and press **Edit**.
This will bring up a menu where you can add new fields to the chosen property category.

### Field parameters

- Field type
- Field priority (higher priority appears earlier)
- Field name
- Long description/explanation (optional)
- Hint (optional)
- Replacement string (in document)  
This field should also be in the template **.docx**.
- Minimum length (constraint, optional)
- Maximum length (constraint, optional)

`-1` length means length is not defined.

As an example, we will create a new field, "Brand":

Brand:
- Field type: Character string
- Field priority: 10
- Field name: Brand
- Replacement string: {car_brand}
