## What's Project Raccoon?

Project Raccoon is a simple application to create, sign, and manage sell
contracts. It offers a simple to use interface to create new contracts from
templates made by administrators, and to create new Properties from categories made by administrators.

Both the buyer and seller must sign the document for it to be considered legally
binding.
